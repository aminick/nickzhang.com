# About me
I'm Nick Zhang, a full stack web developer. For as long as I can remember, I've always been curious and fascinated with computers. My journey to the world of coding all started from a graphing calculator(fx-9750gii) I got when I was 11. I would spend hours coding simple games on its tiny screen with a "BASIC" like language. Since then, I've never stopped learning. About 4 years ago, I started concentrating my focus to web development. I've always had a heart of craftsman, and web technologies provide me the perfect tools to build beautiful and meaningful products. As someone who is very detail oriented, I treat every project like my elaborate creations. Not only I try to make the representation appealing, but also I aim to write professional, maintainable and scalable code.

I currently work with:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- Webpack
