# About me
I'm Nick Zhang, a Front-end developer. I work with JavaScript, HTML and CSS especially within the JAMstack. My first time coding was on a [graphic calculator](https://www.google.com/search?q=casio+fx-9750gii&tbm=isch&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwiZp-T-_dzoAhUSmp4KHayTAu4QBXoECAEQQQ&biw=1920&bih=946) at 11 and I was fascinated. Since then, I've never stopped learning. Today, I aim to build products with professional, maintainable and scalable code base.
